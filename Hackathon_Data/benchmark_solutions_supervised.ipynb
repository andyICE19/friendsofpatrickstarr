    "# Automated metadata matching\n",
    "\n",
    "Life sciences (LS)/ Clinical research institutes (academic research institutes, pharma companies, hospitals, clinics etc.) across the world are producing large volumes of data from patients. This can range from clinical information such as diagnostic/prognostic data, omic data such as genetic/proteomic/epigenetic screens, pathological data such as MRI scans etc. One of the main objectives in LS research (both academic and industrial) is to gain actionable insights from these data sets, that goes beyond the diagnosis/prognosis of a (group of) patient(s) and provides a deeper understanding of the diseases, as well as shine lights on new therapeutic options. It is becoming apparent, that to gain actionable insights from LS data sets, we need data from a large number of patients. This is achievable, if we could merge datasets from various institutes, which is turning out to be hugely challenging task, simply because different institutes use different standards, units, nomenclature etc. to store data. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, patient's age is a common clinical parameter recorded by almost all organisations. One institute can name the variable that records patientsâ€™ age as 'patient age', another can name the same variable as 'age', others can name it as 'age at diagnosis', 'days since birth', 'years since birth' etc. The values can also be in days, months, years etc. Therefore, to combine data from many institutes (and sometimes within same institutes), it's essential to understand that all of the above variables are recording the same thing, i.e. patient's age, also we need to make sure that the units (days, months, years) of measuring age are homogenised at the time of integration. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To assist in the above process the National Cancer Institute (NCI) created the concept of CDE (common data element). See https://cdebrowser.nci.nih.gov/cdebrowserClient/cdeBrowser.html#/search for more details. A big data dump of about 69000 CDE elements are provided in 'cde_database\\full_database' folder in XML format, if you want to further explore. They provide a standard format of representing Life Science's data. This gives us standard variable name, the permissible values , units etc. for each of these clinical parameters. Some research organizations are following this standard, but vast majority aren't. Additionally, there is huge amount of data produced until now which are not standardized using CDEs. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to integrate data from various institutes, we need to be able to match the variable names in the clinical datasets to the corresponding CDE elements. Currently, there is a drive for developing ML/AI algorithms to achieve this.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below is an initial attempt in this direction. In summary, it tries to match the variables names (generally the column headers in a clinical data file) and values (the column values) of the clinical parameters in a dataset, to the long variable names, and permissible values of the CDE elements. The objective is to find the CDE elements that closely match the each clinical parameter name (i.e. the column header). To do the the following steps are performed: <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Converted selected aspects (e.g. long_name, permissible_values etc.) of all CDE elements into numerical vectors using a word embedding model which itself was trained on these data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Coverted the clinical parameter names (headers) and values into numerical vector using the same word embedding model as above.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The vectors from the clinical data can be matched to CDE vectors in a few different ways: <br>\n",
    "   (a) One way is to use unsupervised learning, fit a Nearest Neighbour model to the CDE vectors, and look for the nearest neighbors of each clinical parameter using this model.\n",
    "   (b) Another way is to use supervised learning: Create feature vectors for all possible pairs of clinical parameters and CDE elements, consider the true pairs as positive class (target =1) and the remaining pairs as negative class (target = 0). Train classifiers to this data and use the classifier to evaluate new clinical parameters.\n",

    "Fasttext is a word embedding algorithm developed by FaceBook. Given a corpus, it creates a model that tries to predict if a pair of words appear in the same context. The model first converts the words to a numeric vector which are used as features for the above prediction. We are interested in the feature generation part, i.e. the part which converts words to numeric vectors. For more information on the FastText model see https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/fasttext.html.\n",

    "\n",
    "To train a FastText model we first extracted the long_name and permissible_values of each CDE elements. These were then parseed and cleaned (lower cased, alphanumeric character only, splitted into bag of words). The preprocessed long names and permissible values of all CDE element was considered as the training corpus for the FastText model. The corpus was then used to train A FastText model. The parameters for the model are in the above json file. The trained model is then used to index the CDE elements (i.e. create numeric vectors representing each CDE). We created two sets of vectors for CDE elements, one for the long_names and the other for permissible values. We alo extracted the data_type information for each CDE elements. Below is an example. Let's assume that the following is a (oversimplified) CDE element .\n",

To do that, we vectorized each word (i.e. 'received' and 'radiotherapy') of the long name entry separately. The vectors were then normalized by their L2 norms and averaged. Say for example, the long_name vector is [0.1, 0.345]. \n",

The vectors were then normalized by their L2 norms and averaged.Say for example, the permissible vector is [0.981, 0.233]. \n",

The ratio of undersampling (number of cases target = 0 / number of cases target =1 ) can be adjusted using the params dictionary. The defalut value is 5 which means in the undersampled base tables, 16.67 % of cases have target =1 and 83.33% of cases have target = 0.\n",
